# Optimal Learning Rate

This repository contains an example code for finding the optimal learning rate for a neural network model using grid search. It uses the MLPClassifier model from sklearn and a synthetic dataset generated by make_classification function. By defining a range of learning rates to test and using a GridSearchCV object, the code finds the optimal learning rate that yields the best performance for the given dataset.

## Usage

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/optimal-learning-rate.git
Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code: python optimal_learning_rate.py

## Note
The example uses a synthetic dataset, you can replace it with your own dataset and adjust the parameters accordingly, also feel free to experiment with different range of learning rates, and different optimization algorithms.
